# React + Vite Project Setup

This is a React application built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js 20 or higher** - Vite 7.0 requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** package manager

### Check Your Node.js Version

If you don't have Node.js installed or need to upgrade, download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required project dependencies:

### 3. Start Development Server

Launch the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):


The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The development server starts quickly and provides instant hot reloading when you make changes to your code.

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`** - Starts the development server
- **`npm run build`** - Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder
- **`npm run preview`** - Serves the production build locally for testing
- **`npm run lint`** - Runs ESLint to check code quality (if configured)

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your application:


This command will:
- Compile and optimize your React code
- Bundle all assets for production
- Generate optimized static files in the `dist` directory

To test the production build locally:

This will serve the production build at `http://localhost:3000`.
